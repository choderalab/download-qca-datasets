# Download QM dataset stored in QCArchive
This repository contains scripts to download QM datasets from QCArchive. This repository is part of [espaloma-0.3.0-manuscript](https://github.com/choderalab/espaloma-0.3.0-manuscript).

## Description
QM datasets from QCArchive (`Dataset`, `OptimizationDataset`, `TorsionDriveDataset`) are downloaded via [QCPortal](https://docs.qcarchive.molssi.org/projects/QCPortal/en/latest/), a client interface to the [QCArhive Project](http://docs.qcarchive.molssi.org/en/latest/). Extensive chemical molecules, such as small molecules, peptides, and nucleic acids, were downloaded, and their QM potential energies, forces, coordinates, atomic numbers, and canonical isomeric explicit hydrogen mapped SMILES are stored as HDF5 files. All QM datasets downloaded in this repository were generated using `B3LYP-D3BJ/DZVP` level of theory which is the default theory used for force field development by the [Open Force Field Initiative](https://openforcefield.org/). This level of theory balances the computational efficiency and accuracy to reproduce the conformations generated by higher levels of theories ([ref](https://docs.openforcefield.org/projects/bespokefit/en/stable/users/theory.html)).
