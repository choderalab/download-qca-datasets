## Description

- `Dataset` - QCArchive using Basic workflow. Collects single point energy calculation results of a given molecule.
- `OptimziationDataset` - QCArchive using Optimization workflow. Geometry optimization calcuations are performed for a given molecule.
- `TorsionDriveDataset` - QCArchive using TorsionDriveDataset workflow. Torsion scanning and geometry optimization is performed for a specific set of dihedral angles for a given molecule.

## Notes
- See [Overview of QCArchive](https://docs.qcarchive.molssi.org/projects/QCPortal/en/stable/collections.html) for more detail.
